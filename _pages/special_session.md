**Call for Papers**


Drought, population growth, energy use, land use, socioeconomic changes, and a shifting climate increase water demand and exacerbate pressure on water, energy, and food infrastructure. Therefore, it is critical to re-think how energy is produced and consumed in the water and food sectors. Critical thinking is particularly relevant in the industrial sectors, which are responsible for 25.3% of the final end-use of energy, and 40% of the total water abstractions in the EU alone. Historically, interactions between water, energy, and food have been explored only at the macro-scale, considering only city-to-national-to-international inter-dependencies of the Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN). This approach has proven particularly ineffective in power generation (both traditional and renewable) and several industries such as manufacturing, mining, and agriculture. Adopting renewable energy technologies such as Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) can have substantial positive spill-over effects in the water and food sectors. However, the state-of-the-art is very limited when it comes to understanding the roles that RES and DERs can play in the WEFN. This special session aims to provide a platform for researchers and participants from academic and industrial sectors to report recent research findings and industrial applications concerning the role of RESs and DERs in the Water-Energy-Food Nexus.

Topics of the Session include, but are not limited to:

- WEFN Monitoring and Use of Machine Learning
- Integration of RES and DERs in the WEFN
- Human Factors in the WEFN
- User Experience and WEFN Visualization
- Public Datasets
- Standards for Data Sharing and Re-use
- Decision-Making Tools
- WEFN Integration in Industrial Buildings
- WEFN in Industrial Organization Activities
- Optimization Considering WEFN Global Vision


**Important Dates**

- Deadline for submission of papers: ~~March 01, 2023~~ March 31, 2023
- Notification of acceptance of papers: ~~April 15, 2023~~ May 15, 2023
- Final manuscripts due: June 05, 2023


**Submissions Procedure**

Prospective authors are invited to submit full regular papers of their work electronically. English is the working language of the Conference. Papers are limited to **six (6) pages**. Up to two (2) additional pages can be accepted, but additional page fees must be paid at registration.

All the instructions for paper submission are included in the conference website [submissions page](https://2023.ieee-indin.org/papersubmission.php).
