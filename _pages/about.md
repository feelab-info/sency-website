Energy production, distribution, and consumption account for a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions, driving climate change and threatening sustainable development. Industrial kitchens—restaurants and large-scale food preparation facilities—are among the most energy-intensive commercial buildings, **using 5 to 7 times more energy per square meter than typical commercial spaces**.

**SENCY** is a research and innovation project aiming to transform industrial kitchens into more sustainable, efficient, and energy-integrated environments. By leveraging real data collected from multiple Portuguese restaurants, the project develops advanced forecasting models and digital tools, such as digital twins, to monitor and optimize energy and water consumption.

Furthermore, **SENCY** explores strategies to integrate renewable energy sources and local storage, enabling industrial kitchens to actively participate in electricity markets and contribute to reducing their carbon footprint. Focusing on technological innovation and end-user acceptance, **SENCY** aims not only to reduce operational costs and waste but also to promote a proactive role for restaurants in the national energy transition.

**SENCY** is the third phase of a research initiative led by two [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/) Associated Laboratories, [ITI/LARSyS](https://www.ITI.larsys.pt) and [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), both recognized for excellence in consecutive evaluations. It builds on two previous projects, Future Industrial Kitchen (FIK) and [Exploring the Human-Water-Energy Nexus in Industrial Kitchens (nexIK)](https://nexik.tecnico.ulisboa.pt). The initial 12-month FIK project developed and tested sensing technologies in three restaurants, while the 24-month nexIK project expanded this research nationally, collecting long-term data and exploring new opportunities for sustainability in the sector.


The **SENCY** project is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and by FCT through national funds.
